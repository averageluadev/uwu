Diffusion is the net movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area of low
concentration down a concentration gradient. This is a passive process and does not require
energy. Small molecules (e.g. O2 and CO2) move across membranes by diffusion.
Factors affecting the rate of diffusion include:
● Temperature - the higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy possessed by molecules
and the faster the rate of diffusion.
● Concentration gradient - the steeper the concentration gradient, the faster the rate of
diffusion.
Visking tubing (permeable, plastic tubing) can be used as a model of living material to investigate
the rate of diffusion.
