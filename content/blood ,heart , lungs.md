 **The need for a respiratory system**
Unlike smaller organisms, large multicellular organisms require a respiratory system because:
● Small Surface Area/Volume ratio
● Diffusion insufficient to provide all cells with the required O2 and to remove all CO2

***Structure of the respiratory system***

Pathway of gas through the respiratory system:
nose → trachea → bronchi → bronchioles → alveoli → capillaries

Cells lining the surface of the respiratory tract produce mucus. This is sticky and traps harmful substances and organisms, preventing entry into the lungs. Ciliated epithelial cells found lining the respiratory tract move in a synchronised wave to beat mucus up to the back of the throat where it is swallowed. This protects the lungs from infection.

**ventilation**
ventilation is the movement of fresh air into the lungs and stale air out of the lungs via inspiration (breathing in) and expiration (breathing out). The processes of inspiration and expiration are outlined in the table below:

| inspiration                                | expiration                                  |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| ribs move up and out                       | ribs move down and in                       |
| diaphragm contracts and flattens           | diaphragm relaxes and reverts to dome shape |
| volume of thorax increases                 | volume of thorax decreases                  |
| Thoracic pressure falls below air pressure | thoracic pressure rises above air pressure  |
| air moves into trachea                     | air moves out of trachea                    |
A bell jar model can be used as a model of ventilation.

As the rubber sheet is drawn down during inspiration, the volume of the bell jar increases and its pressure falls below air pressure. Air moves into the glass tube and balloons causing inflation.

**Limitations of the bell jar model**


| thorax                                     | bell jar model               |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| thoracic cavity filled with pleural fluid  | bell jar filled with air     |
| Cartilage in trachea flexible              | Glass tube rigid             |
| Diaphragm flattens                         | Rubber sheet drawn downwards |
| Lungs composed of many alveoli             | balloons empty               |
| Ribs move to change thoracic cavity volume | Bell jar does not move       |
**alveoli**
The alveoli are a cluster of air sacs found in the lungs where gas exchange occurs:
● O2 diffuses from air in the alveoli into blood in the capillaries
● CO2 diffuses from blood in the capillaries into air in the alveoli
![[Pasted image 20240402083137.png]]
Alveoli are adapted for gas exchange:
● Large surface area
● Surrounded by a network of capillaries giving a good blood supply
● Rapid blood flow maintains a steep concentration gradient
● Thin wall gives a short diffusion distance
● Walls covered by thin, moist film, allowing gases to dissolve and increasing diffusion rate
**Composition of inspired and expired air**

| gas            | %inspired air | % expired air |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| oxygen         | 21            | 16            |
| carbon dioxide | 0.04          | 4             |
| nitrogen       | 79            | 79            |
| water vapour   | variable      | 1             |
To test for the presence of CO2, bubble gas through lime water. CO2 turns lime water milky.


**The effects of smoking on the respiratory system**
Several chemicals found in tobacco smoke cause damage to the respiratory system. The effects of
each are described in the table below:

| chemical        | effect                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| carcinogens     | Chemicals that increase the risk of cancer, e.g. lung, oesophagus, mouth                                                                                                                                          |
| tar             | sticky substance deposited in the airways. Stimulates mucus production.<br>Paralyses the cilia, preventing mucus from being swept away. Mucus<br>contains microorganisms and dirt builds. Leads to smoker’s cough |
| nicotine        | Addictive. Increases heart rate. Directly damages lungs.                                                                                                                                                          |
| carbon monoxide | Binds with haemoglobin in red blood cells irreversibly, reducing the<br>oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.                                                                                                    |

Damage to the alveoli walls and loss of elasticity in the alveoli can lead to emphysema, a lung condition resulting in breathing difficulties
