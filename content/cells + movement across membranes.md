**Cells**
Animal and plant cells
Both plant and animal cells contain the following organelles:
● Cytoplasm - fluid component (contains organelles, enzymes, etc.), site of most cellular
reactions.
● Nucleus - stores genetic information in the form of DNA, controls cellular activities.
● Cell membrane - controls the entry and exit of materials into and out of the cell.
● Mitochondria - site of later stages of aerobic respiration in which energy is released.
Plant cells contain some organelles that animal cells do not:
● Cell wall - made from cellulose, provides strength, prevents the cell bursting when water
enters by osmosis.
● Vacuole - contains cell sap (a solution of salts, sugars and organic acids), supports the cell,
maintaining its turgidity.
● Chloroplasts - site of photosynthesis, contain photosynthetic pigments e.g. chlorophyll


**Microscopy**


| term          | definition                                                                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Magnification | Number of times bigger an image appears compared to the size of the specimen |
| Resolution    | Smallest distance between two objects that can be distinguished              |


Animal and plant cells can be observed using a light microscope. A beam of light is passed through a specimen. 
It travels through the eyepiece lens, allowing the specimen to be observed.

The development of microscopes has enabled scientists to increase their understanding of cells.

Greater magnifications and resolutions allow small sub-cellular structures (e.g. mitochondria) to be observed in detail. 
This enables scientists to develop more accurate explanations about how cell structure relates to function.

**Cell differentiation**

Cell differentiation produces specialised cells with specific functions e.g. red blood cells, sperm cells. 
Some genes are switched on or off, determining cell type.
Once a cell differentiates, it cannot divide to make an unspecialised cell, nor a cell which has a different specialised function.

**Organisation**

| organ        | A group of tissues that work together to perform a specific function        | brain  ,   heart                   |
| organ system | A collection of organs that work together to perform a specific function    | digestive system  , nervous system |
| organism     | A group of organ systems that work together to perform a specific function  | human    , sunflower               |

**movement across cell membranes**
Cell membranes are selectively permeable enabling the passage of some substances through
them. There are three methods of transport across cell membranes:
● [[diffusion]]
● [[osmosis]]
● [[active transport]]
