**The need for digestion**

Biological molecules are important in organisms to build structures and for use in metabolic
reactions. Large molecules are made when many smaller molecules join together. The main
biological molecules are:
● Fats - made up of glycerol and fatty acids.
● Carbohydrates - made up of simple sugars e.g. starch is made from glucose molecules.
● Proteins - made up of amino acids.
Digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble molecules of food into smaller soluble molecules.
This is important because:
● Large molecules are too big to be absorbed across the surface of the gut wall.
● Ensures food molecules are soluble so that they can be transported in the bloodstream.
The smaller, soluble molecules can then be used to resynthesise larger molecules or used in
cellular reactions e.g. glucose used in respiration, amino acids used to form proteins.

**Digestive enzymes**
The breakdown of food molecules is catalysed by a range of digestive enzymes. There are three
main types of enzyme:

| enzyme        | function                                                        | location                            |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Carbohydrases | Catalyse the breakdown of carbohydrates into simple<br>sugars   | Mouth, pancreas,<br>small intestine |
| Proteases     | Catalyse the breakdown of proteins into amino acids             | Stomach, small<br>intestine         |
| Lipases       | Catalyse the breakdown of fats into glycerol and fatty<br>acids | Pancreas, small<br>intestine        |
**the digestive system**
The digestive system consists of the digestive tract and associated organs.
Three processes take place in the digestive system: digestion, absorption and egestion

**Structure of the digestive system**
![[Pasted image 20240402084430.png]]
Each organ in the digestive system is specialised for a particular function. The roles of some
digestive organs are outlined below:

| structure       | function                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| mouth           | ● Food chewed and broken into smaller pieces - mechanical digestion<br>● Amylase in the saliva breaks down starch into maltose                                                             |
| stomach         | ● Secretes protease which breaks down proteins<br>● Contains hydrochloric acid which kills any bacteria present in food                                                                    |
| pancreas        | ● Secretes carbohydrase and lipase (transported to small intestine)                                                                                                                        |
| small intestine | ● Completes digestion:<br>- Carbohydrases break down carbohydrates<br>- Proteases break down proteins<br>- Lipases break down lipids<br>● Food molecules are absorbed into the bloodstream |
| large intestine | ● Reabsorbs water into the bloodstream                                                                                                                                                     |
| liver           | ● Produces bile                                                                                                                                                                            |
| gall bladder    | ● Stores bile prior to its release into small intestine                                                                                                                                    |
| rectum          | ● Stores faeces prior to egestion                                                                                                                                                          |
| anus            | ● Where faeces are egested                                                                                                                                                                 |

**Peristalsis**

Peristalsis is the process by which food moves through the digestive system. It is a wave of muscle contractions in the gut wall which forces food down the gut

**bile**

Bile (a liquid secreted by the liver) aids the digestion of lipids in the small intestine by:
● Neutralising acid from the stomach to provide optimum conditions for enzymes in the small
intestine.
● Emulsifying lipids to provide a greater surface area for lipases to digest them.

**Adaptations of the small intestine**

The small intestine is adapted for the absorption of food molecules into the bloodstream:
● Surrounded by a network of capillaries which provide a good blood supply,maintaining a steep concentration gradient.
● Many villi in the walls of the small intestine to increase the surface area for absorption.
● Walls of villi one cell thick giving a short diffusion distance.

**Model of the digestive system**
Visking tubing (permeable, plastic tubing) can be used as a model of the gut. However, there are some limitations of this:

| gut                                                                                     | visking tubing                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gut wall consists of living cells which can<br>transport molecules via active transport | Non-living cells so no active transport                          |
| No pores in gut wall                                                                    | Contains pores                                                   |
| Villi provide large surface area                                                        | Smaller surface area as no villi                                 |
| Bloodstream maintains steep concentration gradient                                      | Uses distilled water so concentration gradient is not maintained |
