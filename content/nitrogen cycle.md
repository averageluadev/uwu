[[eutrophication]]
[[decompisition]] 

1. Organisms die and decompose. Decomposers break down proteins and urea into
ammonia.
2. Bacteria in the soil convert ammonia into nitrates which are taken up by plants and
used to build proteins.
3. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria (in the soil and root nodules of legumes) also convert
nitrogen gas into nitrates which are taken up by plants.
4. Feeding passes nitrogen through the food chain.
5. Denitrifying bacteria convert nitrates in the soil back to nitrogen gas. This occurs in
anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils.
