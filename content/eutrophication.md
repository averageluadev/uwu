Excess fertiliser or untreated sewage may wash into water sources causing eutrophication:
1. Fertiliser or sewage enters rivers and lakes.
2. Nutrient build-up in water.
3. Algal bloom blocks sunlight.
4. Aquatic plants cannot photosynthesise âˆ´ less oxygen produced.
5. They die and decompose.
6. Decomposers further deplete oxygen levels.
7. Animals can no longer respire aerobically so die.
