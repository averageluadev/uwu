**Cellular respiration**
Respiration is a series of enzyme-controlled reactions that release energy (in the form of ATP)
from the breakdown of organic compounds (e.g. glucose). It involves a sequence of exothermic
chemical reactions occurring in the mitochondria and cytoplasm of cells.
Respiration is important because a constant supply of energy is required for many essential
processes in living cells e.g. movement, homeostasis and active transport.
There are two types of respiration: aerobic and anaerobic.


**Aerobic respiration**

Aerobic respiration releases energy from the breakdown of glucose in the presence of oxygen:
*glucose + oxygen → carbon dioxide + water (+ energy)*

**anerobic respiration**
Anaerobic respiration takes place without oxygen (e.g. during vigorous exercise) and releases
energy from the partial breakdown of glucose. In animal cells, lactic acid is produced:
glucose → lactic acid (+ energy)
Anaerobic respiration produces an ‘oxygen debt’ due to lactic acid build-up. To ‘repay’ this, extra
oxygen must be taken in after anaerobic respiration to break down lactic acid in the liver.

| aerobic respiration                     | anaerobic respiration           |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| uses oxygen                             | no oxygen needed                |
| produces carbon dioxide , water and atp | produces lactic acid + atp      |
| produces more atp                       | produces less atp               |
| complete breakdown of glucose           | incomplete breakdown of glucose |
